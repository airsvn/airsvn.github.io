## My goal

I started this blog to deepen my understanding of artificial intelligence and to document my learning journey. I intend to post regularly and build a habit of consistent research and writing.

## Why I created this blog

First, I wanted a space to track my progress — a place where I can reflect on what I learn and share it with others. Writing in English also helps me improve my language skills while engaging with technical content.

Although I aim to publish frequently, I won’t post every single day. Quality matters: I spend time reading, researching, and experimenting before sharing insights that are valuable and reliable.

I welcome constructive feedback. If you have questions, suggestions, or topics you’d like to see covered, feel free to reach out!
